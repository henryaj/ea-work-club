  <p>If you're looking to find a high-impact job, or do some high-impact volunteering, it's hard to know where to look.</p>

  <p>There's the <a href='https://80000hours.org/job-board/'>80,000 Hours job board</a> – which is great, though doesn't accept public submissions, and is skewed towards AI research openings.</p>

  <p>There's also the <a href='https://www.facebook.com/groups/1062957250383195/'>Effective Altruism Job Postings</a> Facebook group, which does accept public submissions, but is hard to search, and there aren't personalised alerts.</p>

  <p>There isn't a single, authoritative source for high-impact job openings and volunteer opportunities. So I decided to make one. <a href="mailto:henry@henrystanley.com">Let me know your thoughts on it.</a></p>
